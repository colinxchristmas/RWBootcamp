I graduated with an AA in Computer Science - MIS from Sierra College in 2016. I have primarily been programming in Ruby on Rails since graduation. I have experience in PHP, CSS, HTML, Linux Bootstrap/SASS, Git, Postgres and a little Vanilla JS.  

I love programming solutions to help people and companies in the window film *(window tint)* and automotive aftermarket installation industries. I built a comission tracker for my fellow employees and industry associates. I wrote it in Ruby on Rails and left basic Bootstrap for the style until it could be updated. It can be found at <https://commission.report/>.

I would love to move industries and get into iOS or Ruby on Rails. I enjoy the challenge and problem solving required as a programmer.
